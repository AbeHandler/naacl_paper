The distributional hypothesis holds that the meaning of a word can be inferred from its distribution. It is reasonable to ask if this hypothesis might hold more true for some sorts of words than for others. For instance, the noun \textit{forrest} might often co-occur frequently with the nouns \textit{leaf} or \textit{tree} -- or the verbs \textit{logging} or \textit{preservation}. But the adjectives \textit{clear} or \textit{direct} might be used to describe many different kinds of nouns in may different contexts (\textit{clear water} or \textit {clear thought}). Thus the co-occurance of nouns might carry more hints about the meanings of the nouns than the co-occurance of an adjective and its modifier. To what extent do differences in part of speech impact word2vec's ability to uncover lexical relations?  

We test this question by counting the total possible synsets for each word from the Reuters corpus and each of its corresponding related words in word2vec -- then comparing this number of total possible relations to the total count of actual relations. For instance, the Reuters word \textit{typos} has 1 Wordnet synset that is a noun. Its 187th closest neighbor in word2vec, \textit{errors}, has seven synsets in word2vec that are nouns. That means that there are 126 possible combinations of synsets that may form a relation. Wordnet considers 'develop' a hyponym of 'create'

Differences in part of speech might be important for both the strong and weak versions of the distributional hypothesis. In the case of the weak version, 

We find that this is indeed the case. This shows that at least in the case of lexical semantics, the distributional hypothesis performs better for certain parts of speech than for others.
